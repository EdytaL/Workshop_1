# SitOnChair

SitOnChair is the simple website I have done as one of my final project in an coding bootcamp.

In this project I used:

 * HTML 
 * CSS
 * JavaScript to make website interactive
 * Git

[Check the running website in this page.](https://edytal.github.io/Workshop_1/)


In SitOnChair the user can see hidden menu on header, use slider to see virtual products and submit the message using form.

Using the calculator the user can calculate the costs of purchase and delivery of the selected product.
